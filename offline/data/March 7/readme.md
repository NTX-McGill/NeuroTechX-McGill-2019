We had connectivity issues with OpenBCI today and didn’t get a lot done. (e.g. readings kept railing, OpenBCI wouldn't start up)

Trials 1-4 are essentially the same, but there is a lot of garbage data at the beginning of trial 1 (might have to backtrack 10 seconds from the first ‘left clench.’ 

Notes from today's session: 
-	Need to use grey wire (no. 1 on OpenBCI) because only stream 1 gets FFT
- Need to control rest condition (e.g. keep both arms rested on a table and make sure both legs touch the ground)
- How to minimise stress on the BCI wires?
